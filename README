TwitterUI
---------

TwitterUI is a small Shoes app, and yet another Twitter client for
the desktop.  Since Shoes is still being developped, twitterui is more
an experiment than a stable alternative to the other three thousand
Twitter-apps around there.

It is designed so far to be:
    * usable, and feature-complete,
    * pretty (for some definitions of pretty),
    * and simple.

I hope you enjoy it.

Install
-------

You need Shoes to get this application working.

The Shoes toolkit can be downloaded from
http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/shoes, and you should get a late
(unpolished) build to run the application: so, have a look at 
http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/shoes/wiki/RecentBuilds

Once you get Shoes to run on your system, simply launch:

    shoes twitterui.rb


I only ran TwitterUI on Linux systems (Debian, and and a XUbuntu-ed
eeePC), so I'd be pleased to know if you get it to run nicely on other
platforms. :)
